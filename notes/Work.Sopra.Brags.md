# Pre 6-month probation
- Got my diploma for my MSc degree with a distinction
- Been offered to be help with the Recruitment process
- Created a training course for new trainees and spearheaded the project for training people on the basics of Argo
- Finished training in the time required and then immediately went into a team (8.47) before any of the other trainees (who'd begun before me)
- Completed lots of tickets around removal of jobs and authorities and custom code deletion
- Understanding more about platform issuer causing a bug in both `.388` and `.220` which then allowed me to increase my ability of skirting through code and then bringing relevant interface implementations across to another branch to test a bug

# 1 year pay review
- Completed resiliency testing with Gerald which involved trying to get to grips with Terraform and the `us-east-2` env for testing in Ohio, involved over 30 PRs and 3 days of work with Gerald and Max standing up new databases, eks workers and file systems, getting access to AWS to monitor changes and try and keep track of lots of moving parts, learned that sandbox-resources vs applications have main differences that the resources are pure yaml and the application files are `hamal` which are more helm specific.
