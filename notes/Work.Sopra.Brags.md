# Pre 6-month probation
- Got my diploma for my MSc degree with a distinction
- Been offered to be help with the Recruitment process
- Created a training course for new trainees and spearheaded the project for training people on the basics of Argo
- Finished training in the time required and then immediately went into a team (8.47) before any of the other trainees (who'd begun before me)
- Completed lots of tickets around removal of jobs and authorities and custom code deletion
- Understanding more about platform issuer causing a bug in both `.388` and `.220` which then allowed me to increase my ability of skirting through code and then bringing relevant interface implementations across to another branch to test a bug

# 1 year pay review
