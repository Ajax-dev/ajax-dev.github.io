Encapsulation is effectively keeping all details of the class hidden from the outside unless needed and finding ways to deliver data outside of the class without exposing it to direct edit.

### Getters and Setters
Useful for updating and retrieving variable outside the encapsulating class.
If we have lots of public variables, we lose control over the data.
Since anyone could change non-private fields we cannot achieve **immutability**.
