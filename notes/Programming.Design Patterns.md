*A general repeatable solution to commonly occurring problem in software design.
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many situations.*

## Creational
These are about class instatiation, pattern can be divided into class-creation and object-creation.

- **[[Abstract Factory | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/abstract_factory]]** - Creates instance of several families of classes
- **[[Builder | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/builder]]** - Separates object construction from its representation 
- **[[Factory Method | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/factory_method]]** - creates an instance of several derived classes
- **[[Object Pool | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/object_pool]]** -  avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- **[[Prototype | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/prototype]]** - a fully initialised instance to be copied or cloned
- **[[Singleton | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/singleton]]** - a class which only a single instance can exist

## Structural
These are about Class and Object composition, these design patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces defining ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- **[[Adapter | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/adapter]]** - Match interfaces of different classes
- **[[Bridge | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/bridge]]** - Separates an object's interface from its implementation
- **[[Composite | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/composite]]** - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- **[[Decorator | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/decorator]]** - Add responsibilites to objects dynamically
- **[[Facade | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/facade]]** - A single class that represents an entir subsystem
- **[[Flyweight | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/flyweight]]** - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- **[[Private Class Data | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/private_class_data]]** - Restricts accessor/mutator access
- **[[Proxy | https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/proxy]]** - An object representing another object

## Behavioural
These design patterns are about Class's objects communication, they are those patterns that are concerned with inter-object communication.

## AntiPatterns
Common defective processes and implementations in organisations.
Also a commonly occurring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences, it may be the result of a developer not knowing any better or having applied a good pattern in the wrong context.
