- Downloaded Rancher Desktop and set it up for *containerd* - which is a container runtime for **simplicity, robustness, and portability**

### Basics 
`kubectl` is the command-line tool which allows running of commands against Kubernetes clusters. It can be used for application deployment, inspection or management of cluster resources and the viewing of logs. <br>
[[kubectl Docs | https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/]]

General layout of syntax is: `kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]`
