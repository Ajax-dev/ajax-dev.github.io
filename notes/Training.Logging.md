Usually most use `System.out.println()` methods to output logging messages to the terminal.
There are many logging frameworks like *log4j* and *logback* that can add enhancements to logigng like differing levels of logging output.

Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) is an abstraction for various logging frameworks allowing you to plug in the desired logging framework at *deployment time*.
